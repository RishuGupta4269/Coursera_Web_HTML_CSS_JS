	<h1>The Characters</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="desk tab1 mob"><section><h3>Michael De Santa</h3><p>He's a former bank robber from the Midwest who got a sweetheart deal with the FIB and managed to retire to Los Santos. However, his wife spent most of his money and he is forced to go back to crime in order reclaim his fortune.Michael's story will center around how the breakdown of his bought idyllic life pushes a man to breaking point. He is described as a man with everything and nothing to lose both at the same time, and his seemingly blisful existence in San Andreas will be changed forever by the events of GTA V.</p></section></div>
		<div class="desk tab1 mob"><section><h3>Franklin</h3><p>Franklin is one of the three main Characters in Grand Theft Auto V. He hails from South Los Santos and is an ex-street gangster who’s always looking for new opportunities. He’s a repo man working for Armenian luxury car dealership, which scams ambitious young hotshots by selling them high-end cars they cannot afford, only for Franklin to forcefully take them back when they default on the repayments. He’s befriended Michael after doing a job together and now Michael sees him as “the son he never had.”</p></section></div>
		<div class="desk tab2 mob"><section><h3>Trevor Philips</h3><p>Trevor Philips is the mirror image of Michael. Whereas Michael is established and living the high life, Trevor is stuck in a trailer park. He’s unhinged and untrusting. The pilot lives in filth and isn’t afraid to set a car on fire just because. He’s the dark night to Michael’s bright day, and while all we know is that these former friends had a falling out, it’s enough to be the most interesting story thread we know about GTA V. How could their paths have diverged so much? Does Michael’s place in witness protection mean he double-crossed Trevor? How will that dynamic play out in missions? We’ll have to wait and see.</p></section></div>
